## This is the README for your extension "strigoi"
This is a version of the [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code/) designed to
work with [Sublime Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime).

Big shoutout to [Josh Peng](https://github.com/joshpeng) for his [Charcoal Oceanic Next](https://github.com/joshpeng/Charcoal-Oceanic-Next)
theme. This basically takes the logic of that theme and uses the Dracula colors. Very much a work in progress.
